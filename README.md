# TemetNosceServiceModel
Model repo for the TemetNosceService. This repo will contain all contract related information related to TemetNosceService.

The idea is to have a separate model package specifying the API Contract via Swagger. This will later be used to auto-generate the code at client/server side/API Gateway.
